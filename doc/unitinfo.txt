	<desc>Dark Elf Swordsmen are a group of slender humanoids with violet-colored skin and white hair. They dress in brown leather clothes, carry swords for up-close-and-personal combat, and a large red buckler which protects them from enemy arrows and other ranged attacks. Dark Elves are inherently magical beings, and can channel magical energy into a destructive force on a whim. They are also incredibly resistant to magic and other ill effects.</desc>
