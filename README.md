Open source implementation of Master of Magic using SDL

Needs original Master of Magic .LBX files in the lbx directory in order to work, but is very much work in progress at the moment.
Current Makefile supports only Linux (or g++ rather), but the game itself should work on any platform.

The progress has been slow, due to my personal schedule, but also figuring out the LBX font format has proven to be quite difficult.
